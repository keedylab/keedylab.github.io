  Ali is a BSc (Hons) Biology and MPhil Biochemistry graduate of the University of Portsmouth, UK. 
  His MPhil focused on the characterisation of cellulases involved in the production of second-generation biofuels, 
  igniting an interest into the field of X-ray crystallography. 
  He earned his PhD from the University of Essex, UK, in early 2020, under the co-supervision of 
  [Dr. Mike Hough](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/hough20300/mike-hough) from the University of Essex 
  and [Dr. Robin Owen](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I24/Staff/Owen.html) from Diamond Light Source, UK. 
  His research focused on the development of serial crystallography data collection and processing methods 
  for both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers, 
  used to analyse and exploit the effects of radiation damage in metalloproteins. 
  Ali joined the Keedy lab as a postdoc in the spring of 2020 (though the pandemic had something to say about that...). 
  He aims to bring his experience in crystallographic multi-dataset processing and analysis to the ASRC, 
  in order to further unlock understanding within the field of phosphatase ligand binding, activity, and allostery.
