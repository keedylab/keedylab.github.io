  Sakib is a recent graduate of Hunter College with a major in Chemistry and a concentration in Bioinformatics.
  He joined the Keedy Lab in 2018.
  His research in the lab uses X-ray crystallography to reveal how sequence differences rewire allosteric networks in related phosphatases.
  He has also investigated how protein structures satisfy particular hydrogen bonding interactions in multiple different ways.
  Last but not least, he is the designer of this website!

  Blake joined the Keedy lab as a postdoc in November 2019. He earned his PhD from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), Australia,
  where he worked with [A/Prof. Ashley Buckle](https://www.facebook.com/BuckleLab/)
  on the protein engineering & design of a small, potent, peptidic protease inhibitor from sunflower seeds.


  As part of his doctoral research, he began to explore allosteric inhibition of proteases; he is now exploring allosteric inhibition of phosphatases.


  Blake’s research aims to untangle the allosteric wiring within enzymes using a hybrid experimental and computational approach.
  He is currently developing methods in X-ray crystallography to model multiple conformations into multi-crystal datasets.
