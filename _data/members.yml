  Daniel Keedy started at CUNY as an Assistant Professor in January 2018 
  and was promoted to Associate Professor in September 2025.
  His primary affiliations are with the [Structural Biology Initiative](http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu)
  at the [CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC)](http://asrc.cuny.edu)
  and with the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/Chemistry) 
  at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). 
  He is also affiliated with the PhD Programs in 
  [Biochemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry);
  [Chemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry);
  and [Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCD)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biology/Subprograms/Molecular,-Cellular,-and-Developmental-Biology)
  at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home).
  

  Prior to his appointment at CUNY, Daniel was an AP Giannini Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences 
  at the University of California, San Francisco working with [James Fraser](https://fraserlab.com). 
  He earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Structural Biology & Biophysics from Duke University 
  with [Jane and David Richardson](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu),
  after receiving his BA in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology from Rhodes College. 
  

  As principal investigator of the Keedy lab,
  Daniel develops experimental and computational methods to control proteins by biasing toward specific 
  conformations that underlie functions such as allostery, ligand binding, and catalysis. 
  His work reveals new opportunities to modulate the activities of therapeutic targets 
  such as protein tyrosine phosphatases with small molecules and protein engineering, 
  and also offers insights into more general evolutionary processes that led to functional diversity in the human proteome.
  Daniel also seeks to integrate prospective, collaborative research projects into a classroom setting to catalyze student learning about biochemistry and structural biology.


  The Keedy lab is grateful for federal funding to support our research 
  from the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/),
  including the [National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/frsQBIlZYE-wsguLL38IDQ/project-details/11011728)
  and the [National Institute on Aging (NIA)](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/lDb9M9tKFkSiudk4ZPbJyQ/project-details/10871662),
  and from the [Department of Energy (DOE)](https://science.osti.gov/Initiatives/Biopreparedness).
  Daniel has also received a [Cottrell Scholar Award](https://rescorp.org/cottrell-scholars/2022-cottrell-scholars)
  and a [CCNY CCAPP](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/ccapp) STEM Teacher of the Year Award.

  Luzcairy Diaz is a junior biochemistry student at The City College of New York. 
  She developed a love for the sciences in high school, specifically chemistry and biology, 
  which deepened in college through courses like organic chemistry and, most recently, Professor Keedy’s biochemistry class. 
  These courses allowed her to not only learn theoretical aspects 
  but also experience the unpredictable and intriguing nature of science.
  As a pre-med student, she aims to blend these fundamental aspects of science 
  with interests in clinical medicine developed through her EMT job.
  This led her to join the Keedy Lab in Spring 2026 for Honors research, 
  where she hopes to gain hands-on wet-lab experience and strengthen her understanding of protein biochemistry research.

  Eric is a senior computer science student at Hunter College. 
  Initially, he did research in the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) field working on social robot navigation, 
  but was inspired to try out computational biology after attending the January 2025 Quantitative Methods Workshop (QMW) at MIT. 
  He spent the following summer at MIT in the [Ovchinnikov lab](https://biology.mit.edu/profile/sergey-ovchinnikov/) 
  under the 2025 MSRP-Bio program, where he worked on high-throughput protein purification with a liquid handling robot. 
  To continue gaining experience in computational biology, Eric joined the Keedy lab in Fall 2025, 
  where he hopes to apply his computational skills to tackle interesting problems in structural biology.
