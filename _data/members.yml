  Daniel Keedy has been an Assistant Professor with the [Structural Biology Initiative](http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu)
  at the [CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC)](http://asrc.cuny.edu)
  and the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/Chemistry) 
  at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/) 
  since January 2018. 
  He is also affiliated with the PhD Programs in 
  [Biochemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry);
  [Chemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry);

  at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home).
  

  Prior to his appointment, Daniel was an AP Giannini Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences 
  at the University of California, San Francisco working with [James Fraser](https://fraserlab.com). 
  He earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Structural Biology & Biophysics from Duke University 
  with [Jane and David Richardson](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu),
  after receiving his BA in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology from Rhodes College. 
  

  As principal investigator of the Keedy Lab,
  Daniel develops experimental and computational methods to control proteins by biasing toward specific 
  conformations that underlie functions such as allostery, ligand binding, and catalysis. 
  His work reveals new opportunities to modulate the activities of therapeutic targets 
  such as protein tyrosine phosphatases with small molecules and protein engineering, 
  and also offers insights into more general evolutionary processes that led to functional diversity in the human proteome.
  Daniel has received a [Cottrell Scholar Award](https://rescorp.org/cottrell-scholars/2022-cottrell-scholars)
  and [CCNY CCAPP](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/ccapp) STEM Teacher of the Year Award.

  Ali is a BSc (Hons) Biology and MPhil Biochemistry graduate of the University of Portsmouth, UK. 
  His MPhil focused on the characterisation of cellulases involved in the production of second-generation biofuels, 
  igniting an interest into the field of X-ray crystallography. 
  He earned his PhD from the University of Essex, UK, in early 2020, under the co-supervision of 
  [Dr. Mike Hough](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/hough20300/mike-hough) from the University of Essex 
  and [Dr. Robin Owen](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I24/Staff/Owen.html) from Diamond Light Source, UK. 
  His research focused on the development of serial crystallography data collection and processing methods 
  for both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers, 
  used to analyse and exploit the effects of radiation damage in metalloproteins. 
  Ali joined the Keedy lab as a postdoc in the spring of 2020 (though the pandemic had something to say about that...). 
  He aims to bring his experience in crystallographic multi-dataset processing and analysis to the ASRC, 
  in order to further unlock understanding within the field of phosphatase ligand binding, activity, and allostery.
