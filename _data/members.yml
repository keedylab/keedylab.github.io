  Daniel Keedy started at CUNY as an Assistant Professor in January 2018 
  and was promoted to Associate Professor in September 2025.
  His primary affiliations are with the [Structural Biology Initiative](http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu)
  at the [CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC)](http://asrc.cuny.edu)
  and with the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/Chemistry) 
  at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). 
  He is also affiliated with the PhD Programs in 
  [Biochemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry);
  [Chemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry);
  and [Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCD)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biology/Subprograms/Molecular,-Cellular,-and-Developmental-Biology)
  at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home).
  

  Prior to his appointment at CUNY, Daniel was an AP Giannini Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences 
  at the University of California, San Francisco working with [James Fraser](https://fraserlab.com). 
  He earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Structural Biology & Biophysics from Duke University 
  with [Jane and David Richardson](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu),
  after receiving his BA in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology from Rhodes College. 
  

  As principal investigator of the Keedy lab,
  Daniel develops experimental and computational methods to control proteins by biasing toward specific 
  conformations that underlie functions such as allostery, ligand binding, and catalysis. 
  His work reveals new opportunities to modulate the activities of therapeutic targets 
  such as protein tyrosine phosphatases with small molecules and protein engineering, 
  and also offers insights into more general evolutionary processes that led to functional diversity in the human proteome.
  Daniel also seeks to integrate prospective, collaborative research projects into a classroom setting to catalyze student learning about biochemistry and structural biology.


  The Keedy lab is grateful for federal funding to support our research 
  from the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/),
  including the [National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/frsQBIlZYE-wsguLL38IDQ/project-details/11011728)
  and the [National Institute on Aging (NIA)](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/lDb9M9tKFkSiudk4ZPbJyQ/project-details/10871662),
  and from the [Department of Energy (DOE)](https://science.osti.gov/Initiatives/Biopreparedness).
  Daniel has also received a [Cottrell Scholar Award](https://rescorp.org/cottrell-scholars/2022-cottrell-scholars)
  and a [CCNY CCAPP](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/ccapp) STEM Teacher of the Year Award.

  Shakhriyor "Shah" Djuraev is a senior biochemistry student at The City College of New York 
  with a passion for hands-on laboratory work sparked through his undergraduate biology and chemistry lab courses. 
  Shah built further on his laboratory skills in the CIPASS Biotechnology/Biology Lab Skills Program, 
  where he gained exposure to techniques such as DNA extraction, PCR, western blotting, ELISA, and cell culture, along with protein purification and gel electrophoresis. 
  His academic curiosity deepened in CHEM 32002 (Biochemistry I) with Dr. Keedy, 
  where a group project on engineering mutations in the protein phosphatase PTP1B sparked his interest in protein research. 
  This led Shah to join the Keedy lab in Fall 2024 for Honors research, 
  where he is eager to expand his knowledge of protein phosphatases, refine his wet-lab skills, and explore his future career options. 
  In addition to his academic endeavors, Shah balances his time as a part-time EMT with Assist Ambulance 
  and as a counter person at a bustling Italian American pizzeria in Brooklyn, where he pursues his love for crafting Neapolitan-style pizza.

  Ali is a BSc (Hons) Biology and MPhil Biochemistry graduate of the University of Portsmouth, UK. 
  His MPhil focused on the characterisation of cellulases involved in the production of second-generation biofuels, 
  igniting an interest into the field of X-ray crystallography. 
  He earned his PhD from the University of Essex, UK, in early 2020, under the co-supervision of 
  [Dr. Mike Hough](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/hough20300/mike-hough) from the University of Essex 
  and [Dr. Robin Owen](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I24/Staff/Owen.html) from Diamond Light Source, UK. 
  His research focused on the development of serial crystallography data collection and processing methods 
  for both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers, 
  used to analyse and exploit the effects of radiation damage in metalloproteins. 
  Ali joined the Keedy lab as a postdoc in the spring of 2020 (though the pandemic had something to say about that...). 
  He aims to bring his experience in crystallographic multi-dataset processing and analysis to the ASRC, 
  in order to further unlock understanding within the field of phosphatase ligand binding, activity, and allostery.
