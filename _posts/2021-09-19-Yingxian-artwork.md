Yingxian Tan recently completed her stay in the Keedy lab after two semesters of computational research as an undergraduate during the pandemic, then one partial summer in the wet lab after graduation.  Although we unfortunately didn't manage any photos before she moved on to her graduate program, Yingxian's artistic representation of protein tyrosine phosphatase active-site loops was selected for display right at the entrance to Marshak, the main science building at CCNY (see below)...  Good luck, Yingxian!
