A couple of positive news items to report as we slowly but surely emerge from winter:

First, Shivani has been awarded a Doctoral Student Research Grant (DSRG) of $1,500 from the CUNY Graduate Center!  These funds will allow her to obtain key supplies for her thesis research, and travel to a conference to report her latest findings.  Congratulations!

Second, Nathanael Singh has joined the lab as an undergraduate researcher from CCNY. Nathanael will be working to characterize putative allosteric inhibitors of PTP enzymes, using a variety of experiments to assess their effects on function and struture, as well as other fun side projects... Welcome Nathanael!
