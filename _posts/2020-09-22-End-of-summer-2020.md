It's been a while since the last post!  (I have a feeling this won't be the last time that happens...)  Let's attempt to fill in some gaps in the timeline:

Since my last post, the COVID-19 pandemic hit.  Our wet lab was shut down for months, and we shifted toward data analysis, planning future experiments, and computational projects.  Thankfully we're now back in action in a careful, socially distanced mode.  Despite the challenges of the moment, we've managed to see each other in person from time to time:

One of those occasions was when Maryam finished her >2 year tenure with us!  :cry:  (See photo below -- including social-distancing-friendly elbow bumps.)  But she's going on to bigger and better things with the [CUNY Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCD) PhD Program](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biology/Subprograms/Molecular,-Cellular,-and-Developmental-Biology).  We'll miss you, Maryam -- but at least you won't be too far away!

On the flip side, we've had some fantastic new additions to the lab.  First up: Virgil Woods, a new PhD student from the [CUNY Biochemistry PhD Program](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry).  Second: Yingxian Tan, an undergraduate student from [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/).  You can read more about both over on <a href="/members">our Members page</a>.  Welcome, Virgil and Yingxian!

We are also very excited to begin working with Dr. Ali Ebrahim, currently at [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/), on some avant-garde new crystallographic experiments -- more to come on our projects together quite soon...

On the science side: in October, Daniel gave a "virtual" talk on our (ongoing!) efforts to develop allosteric small-molecule modulators of PTP1B at the American Chemical Society national meeting.  Thanks to our collaborators at Atomwise, you can [view it here](https://blog.atomwise.com/toward-inhibition-of-the-dynamic-enzyme-ptp1b-via-new-allosteric-weak-point).

Finally, the lab has published its first multi-author paper on which Daniel is a corresponding author, initially as a [bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280222v1) but with a peer-reviewed journal article to come soon.  Blake did an admirable job shaping this up and getting it out to the world.  Check out [qFit 3 on GitHub](https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0) and try it yourself!

We have several other interesting stories cooking right now -- so stay tuned for more in the not-too-distant future...
