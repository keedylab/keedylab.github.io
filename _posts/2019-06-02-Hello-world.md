Hello, world! This is the first post from the Keedy Lab.  Only 1+ year late!

We've gotten off to an amazing start in that time.  See below for a photo of the lab during the 2018 holiday season.

Looking forward to what the rest of 2019 and beyond have to bring!  Watch this space...  

Finally, if you are interested in a postdoc position in the lab, please apply by clicking [this link](https://cuny.jobs/new-york-ny/research-associate-structural-biology-initiative/3F61F1DE234B4BF7BA9E5777089B982C/job/).

... and email Dr. Keedy to discuss!
