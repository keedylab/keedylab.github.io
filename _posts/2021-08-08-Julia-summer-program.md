Julia Michalak, an undergraduate student in the B3 REU summer program, finished her project focused on structurally characterizing a new(-to-us) phosphatase, culminating in an outdoor poster session.  She worked with Blake over the course of the summer, including a couple of remote synchrotron X-ray diffraction data collection sessions.  Good luck this coming academic year, Julia!
