Here's what we did on our summer vacation!

Liliana presented a poster at the full [2025 Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) Gordon Research Conference (GRC)](https://www.grc.org/computer-aided-drug-design-conference/2025/), after having attended just the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) last time.

Ali gave a great talk at the summer 2025 [New York Structural Biology Discussion Group (NYSBDG)](https://bsky.app/profile/nysbdg.bsky.social) meeting:

We've also had a few papers reach various stages, including a new review article on PTP dynamics and allostery -- as always, check out our [Publications page](https://keedylab.org/publications/) for the latest.
