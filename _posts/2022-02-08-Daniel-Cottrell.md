Daniel is honored to have received a [2022 Cottrell Scholar Award](https://rescorp.org/news/2022/02/rcsa-welcomes-2022-class-of-cottrell-scholars). These awards are given to early-career scientists with interests in both research and teaching, ideally with integration between the two. With funding from this award, Daniel's lab at the [ASRC](https://asrc.gc.cuny.edu/) will exploit new techniques in structural biology to reveal how atoms in phosphatase enzymes move during catalysis and allostery. At the same time, he will engage his undergraduate biochemistry students at [CCNY](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/) with a new crowd-sourced research project in which students will design and advocate for bespoke phosphatase mutations, attend virtual field trips to the Keedy lab where the mutant proteins will be characterized, and assess the experimental data to internalize lessons about how amino acid sequence determines protein function.
