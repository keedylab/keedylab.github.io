Time for another news roundup... 

First, Ali, Shivani, and I had a fantastic time at the [Gordon Research Seminar](https://www.grc.org/diffraction-methods-in-structural-biology-grs-conference/2022/) and [Gordon Research Conference](https://www.grc.org/diffraction-methods-in-structural-biology-conference/2022/) in Diffraction Methods, which had been delayed since 2020. It was fun to get to see folks face-to-face -- even if we did still have masks on most of the time. Thankfully, no COVID cases were reported. On the scientific side, everyone had something to show for themselves: Ali won a best poster prize for the GRS (congrats!) and was voted co-chair of the next GRS in 2024 (congrats!!), Shivani asked a veritable barrage of insightful and clarifying questions throughout the conference, and I (Daniel) got to show off Tamar's work on protein:ligand crystallography at cryo vs. room temperature in a talk (paper coming soon...).

Speaking of papers: Shivani, Ali, and I managed to pull together a manuscript about our recent serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) structure of apo PTP1B at room temperature. This one is short & sweet, and sets the stage for other exciting serial crystallography studies of PTPs in the future. [Check out the preprint on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.28.501725v1)!

Finally, Jackson finished his [B3 REU program](https://www.b3-reu.ccny.cuny.edu/) with a poster presentation in the quad between the ASRC and CDI. We'll miss you, Jackson -- and best of luck back at Hopkins!
