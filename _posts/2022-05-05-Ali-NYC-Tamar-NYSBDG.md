A couple of quick hitters today. First, after an arduous and harrowing odyssey, Ali finally arrived to the ASRC, where he will continue his work on serial crystallography and pick up other new and exciting projects.  Great to see you in R3, Ali!

Second, Tamar gave a very well-received talk on the temperature-dependence of protein:ligand binding in X-ray crystallography at the [New York Structural Biology Discussion Group (NYSBDG)](https://twitter.com/nysbdgrp) meeting this week (held virtually this time).  The Q&A gave us some excellent food for thought that will be useful as Tamar works toward finishing up her paper on this work.
