It's once again time to hit the highlights with a lab news round-up for the last year or so!

The lab's [NIH R35 grant on allosteric wiring of phosphatases](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/GTUZVXRzoUG574X8lGJJdA/project-details/11011728) was successfully renewed as of late January 2025. 
We are also part of a new [NIH RF1 grant on developing degraders of STEP phosphatase](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/QnQwj85L2kCqxPI7GY3gQQ/project-details/10871662) in collaboration with [Lutz Tautz](https://sbpdiscovery.org/scientists/lutz-tautz-phd/).
We feel very fortunate to have this critically important federal support for our biomedical research...

2024 was a banner year for publications from our lab. 
We've had papers at various stages including preprints, manuscripts in review, manuscripts in revisions, and final journal publications. 
See our [Publications page](https://keedylab.org/publications/) for the latest.

Since the last news post, Daniel gave talks at UC Irvine, Baylor U, the ASRC-CCNY B3 seminar series, the ACA annual meeting, and a Stanford/LCLS workshop on variable-temperature crystallography.
Most importantly, he also took parental leave for baby #2!

Virgil was the recipient of the CUNY Graduate Center Horst Schulz Award, given to the GC Biochemistry PhD student with the best paper in 2024 -- he was honored with a reception where he gave a seminar at the GC recital hall in Midtown.
He also gave a research talk at the ACS spring meeting. 

Shivani gave a talk at the West Coast Structural Biology Workshop at Asilomar -- one of the coolest conference venues in the US.

Liliana was awarded a Mina Rees Dissertation Fellowship from the CUNY Graduate Center for $25,000 which will support her in her last year (or so) at CUNY.

Shah won the George A. & James E. Petersson Fellowship Fund Award from the CCNY Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, and was selected to present a poster at the CUNY-wide Undergraduate Research Celebration Day. 

Big congrats to all of the above!
