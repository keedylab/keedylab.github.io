### Postdocs

If you're currently finishing or have recently finished your PhD, 
and are interested in a postdoctoral position in the lab, 
please email Dr. Keedy and include your CV.


### PhD Students

If you're interested in PhD thesis research in the Keedy Lab, you must first apply to one of the following PhD programs through the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home):
  * [CUNY PhD Program in Biochemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry/Admissions)
  * [CUNY PhD Program in Chemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry/Prospective-Students)
  * [CUNY PhD Program in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCD)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biology/Subprograms/Molecular,-Cellular,-and-Developmental-Biology)

Once you're admitted, you'll have the opportunity to visit the Keedy Lab at the ASRC during interviews, to do a research rotation after you enroll, and to potentially join the lab if there is a good fit.  That said, feel free to email Dr. Keedy before or during the application process to discuss research project ideas!


### Undergraduates

If you are a talented undergraduate interested in doing research in the lab, email Dr. Keedy with your grades in relevant courses (Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, Computer Science, etc.).  I am more likely to accept students who can make a significant time commitment in terms of hours per week in the lab and number of semesters.
